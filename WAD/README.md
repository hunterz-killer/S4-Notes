You can access array elements using their indexes or by using array functions to perform operations on the entire array.

- **String handling functions in PHP:** PHP provides a wide range of functions to handle strings effectively. These functions allow you to manipulate strings, perform string concatenation, extract substrings, search and replace text within strings, and perform various other operations to manipulate and analyze string data.

## What is the purpose of arrays in PHP?

Arrays in PHP serve as fundamental data structures that enable the storage and manipulation of collections of values. They allow for the organization and efficient handling of related data elements.

## How can you manipulate and access array elements in PHP?

In PHP, you can manipulate array elements through various operations:

- **Assigning Values**: You can assign new values to array elements using their indexes or keys. For example:

```php
$myArray[0] = "Value";
```

- **Modifying Values**: Existing values can be modified by reassigning them:

```php
$myArray[1] = "New Value";
```

- **Removing Elements**: Elements can be removed using `unset()`:

```php
unset($myArray[2]);
```
