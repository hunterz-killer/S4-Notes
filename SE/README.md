# Software Engineering

## Design Patterns
- A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
- It is a description for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
- Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects.

## Why do we need design Patterns:
- Creating a class properly
- Instantiating an object to a particular class
- Interaction between objects
- Write loosely coupled code
- Write reusable code

## Advantages of Using Design Patterns in Software Engineering:

- **Reusability:** Design patterns offer tried and tested solutions for reusing in software development.
- **Standardized Terminology:** They establish a common language for developers to communicate and understand design concepts.
- **Higher-Level Perspective:** Design patterns provide a higher-level view of the software architecture.
- **Enhanced Modifiability:** Most patterns make software more flexible and less prone to breaking during changes.
- **Loose Coupling:** Patterns promote loosely coupled applications for better maintainability.
- **Improved Understanding:** They aid in comprehending fundamental object-oriented design principles.

## 5 Basic Components of a Design Pattern:

- **Name:** Identifies the pattern for easy reference and discussion.
- **Problem:** Describes the specific software design issue the pattern addresses.
- **Solution:** Offers a proven approach or template to solve the identified problem.
- **Consequences and Trade-offs:** Outlines the benefits, drawbacks, and considerations of applying the pattern.
- **Implementation:** Provides an architecture using a design class diagram to visualize the pattern's structure.

## Pattern Name:

- **Identification Purpose:** Identifies the specific pattern addressing a particular problem in software design.
- **Descriptive Function:** Used to articulate and define a design challenge within a system.
- **Enhanced Vocabulary:** Naming a pattern expands the design terminology, enabling higher-level conceptualization.
- **Facilitates Abstract Design:** Supports the creation of designs at a more conceptual and less detailed level.
- **Simplified Discussion:** Allows for discussions and evaluations of designs without getting bogged down in implementation specifics.
- **Recalls Problem and Solution:** A well-chosen pattern name should evoke the problems it resolves and the corresponding solution.
- **Examples:** Singleton, Factory Method, Prototype.

## Pattern Problem:

- **Application Context:** Defines the circumstances and context in which the pattern is relevant and beneficial.
- **Problem Description:** Specifies the design challenge being addressed, which may include converting algorithms into object representations.
- **Identifies Design Issues:** Pinpoints class or object configurations indicative of a rigid and less adaptable design.
- **Conditions for Application:** Occasionally outlines a set of prerequisites that must be met before applying the pattern becomes meaningful.

## The Solution
- The solution describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
- The solution doesn't describe a particular concrete design or implementation, because a pattern is like a template that can be applied in many different situations.
- Instead, the pattern provides an abstract description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of elements (classes and objects in our case) solves it

## The Consequences
- The consequences are the results and trade-offs of applying thepattern.
- The consequences for software often concern space and time trade-offs.
- They may address language and implementation issues as well.
- Since reuse is often a factor in object-oriented design, the consequences of a pattern include its impact on a system's flexibility, extensibility, or portability.
- Listing these consequences explicitly helps you understand and evaluate them
