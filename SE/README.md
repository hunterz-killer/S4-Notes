## Software Design:
- In the software design phase, a design document is created based on the customer requirements outlined in the SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document.
- The design process involves translating the information from the SRS document into a comprehensive design document.
- The design document serves as a blueprint for the subsequent coding phase, where the design specifications are implemented using a programming language.

## Outcome of the Design Process:

During the design phase, the following items are designed and documented:

1. **Different Modules:**
   - Identification and definition of distinct modules or components that make up the software system.

2. **Control Relationships Among Modules:**
   - Specification of how different modules interact and communicate with each other to achieve the desired functionality.

3. **Interfaces Among Different Modules:**
   - Definition of the interfaces and interactions between modules, including input/output specifications.

4. **Data Structures of the Individual Modules:**
   - Design and description of the data structures used within each module to store and manipulate information.

5. **Algorithms Required to Implement the Individual Modules:**
   - Development and documentation of the specific algorithms and procedures needed to implement the functionality of each module.

## Software Design Levels:

1. **Architecture Design:**
   - This is the highest level of software design. It defines the overall structure and organization of the software system. It identifies the major components, their relationships, and how they interact to fulfill the system's requirements.

2. **High-Level Design:**
   - At this level, the focus shifts to more detailed design decisions. It expands on the architecture design by specifying the functionality of each major component, the data flow between them, and the interfaces they expose. It may also include decisions about data storage, algorithms, and system dependencies.

3. **Detailed Design:**
   - This is the most granular level of design. It provides specific implementation details for each component, including class and function definitions, data structures, and algorithms. It outlines how each module or component will be coded, tested, and integrated.



## Characteristics of a Good Software Design:
  - Describes the key qualities that define a well-structured software design.

- **Correctness:**
  - A good design must accurately implement all the functionalities specified in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
  - It ensures the software behaves as intended, meeting the stated requirements.

- **Understandability:**
  - The design should not be convoluted or messy but rather easy to comprehend.
  - An easily understandable design facilitates effective implementation and maintenance.

- **Efficiency:**
  - Good designs should address resource, time, and cost optimization.
  - They should be efficient in their use of system resources, enabling the software to perform well.

- **Maintainability:**
  - A well-designed software should be easy to modify and update.
  - Since change requests are common, even after product release, the design should facilitate smooth adaptations to meet evolving needs.


## Important Concepts and Terminologies Associated with Layered Design:

1. **Superordinate and Subordinate Modules:**
   - **Superordinate Modules:** These are higher-level modules that oversee and coordinate the activities of subordinate modules.
   - **Subordinate Modules:** These are lower-level modules that perform specific tasks and report to superordinate modules.

2. **Visibility:**
   - Refers to the degree to which one module can access or interact with another module. It is controlled by the design and encapsulation of the modules.

3. **Control Abstraction:**
   - The level of control and detail a module has over its subordinate modules. It defines how modules interact to achieve a specific function.

4. **Depth and Width:**
   - **Depth:** Refers to the number of hierarchical levels in the layered design, indicating the depth of the module hierarchy.
   - **Width:** Indicates the number of sibling modules at the same level in the hierarchy.

5. **Fan-Out:**
   - The number of subordinate modules controlled or invoked by a superordinate module. High fan-out can indicate complex control relationships.

6. **Fan-In:**
   - The number of superordinate modules that reference or use a particular subordinate module. High fan-in suggests reusability and a modular design.

## Cohesion and Coupling:

- **Cohesion:**
   - Cohesion is a measure of the functional strength of a module. It indicates how closely related and focused the tasks performed by a module are. High cohesion means a module performs a single, well-defined function.

- **Coupling:**
   - Coupling is a measure of the degree of interaction or interdependence between two modules. Low coupling indicates that modules are relatively independent and can be changed or maintained with minimal impact on other modules.

## Functional Independence:

- **Definition:** Functional independence in software design means that a module is capable of performing a single task with minimal interaction with other modules.

- A module that exhibits both high cohesion and low coupling with other modules is considered functionally independent.

## Advantages of Functional Independence:

1. **Better Understandability:**
   - Functional independence reduces design complexity, making it easier to understand the design document. Clear boundaries between modules simplify comprehension.

2. **Isolation:**
   - Isolated modules are self-contained and easily understood within the design. This isolation makes it straightforward to locate and address errors or issues.

3. **Scope of Reuse:**
   - Functionally independent modules are more reusable. They can be readily applied in the development of other applications, promoting efficiency and code reuse.


## Cohesion and Its Types:

- **Cohesion:** Cohesion is a measure of the functional strength of a module. It indicates how closely related and focused the tasks performed by a module are. Good cohesion implies that the functions within a module cooperate to achieve a single objective.

- **Types of Cohesion:**
1. **Functional Cohesion:**
   - All the functions within the module collaborate to achieve a single, well-defined objective. This is the highest level of cohesion.
 
3. **Sequential Cohesion:**
4. Functions within the module are organized in a sequence, with the output of one function serving as the input to the next.

5. **Communicational Cohesion:** Functions within the module operate on the same data or share data among themselves.

6. **Procedural Cohesion:** Functions within the module are grouped based on their execution sequence, but they may not necessarily have a single objective.

7. **Temporal Cohesion:** Functions within the module are executed at the same time, although they may have different purposes.

8. **Logical Cohesion:** Functions within the module have a logical relationship but do not necessarily share data or have a single objective.

 9. **Coincidental Cohesion:** Functions within the module are grouped together by coincidence or convenience rather than any meaningful relationship. This is the lowest level of cohesion.

## Coupling and Its Types:

- **Coupling:** Coupling is a measure of the degree of interaction or interdependence between two modules. It indicates how much one module relies on or is affected by another module.

### Types of Coupling:

1. **Data Coupling:**
   - Data coupling occurs when two modules share data, but they do not share their internal logic. They exchange information using parameters or data structures.

2. **Stamp Coupling:**
   - Stamp coupling happens when modules share complex data structures, like records or arrays, and use only a portion of the data. This type of coupling should be avoided as it can lead to unnecessary dependencies.

3. **Control Coupling:**
   - Control coupling occurs when one module controls the behavior of another by passing control information. This implies a higher level of interdependence.

4. **Common Coupling:**
   - Common coupling arises when modules share global data. Any changes to the global data affect multiple modules, making them tightly coupled.

5. **Content Coupling:**
   - Content coupling is considered the strongest form of coupling. It occurs when one module accesses or modifies the internal data or behavior of another module.


## Function-Oriented Design vs Object-Oriented Design  

| Aspect                   | Function-Oriented Design | Object-Oriented Design   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Approach                 | Top-down approach         | Bottom-up approach       |
| Analysis and Design Method | Structured Analysis and Structured Design | Unified Modeling Language (UML) |
| Programming Language     | Procedural Languages (e.g., C) | Object-Oriented Languages (e.g., Java, C#, C++) |
| Description              | Breaks the system into smaller functions and orchestrates them to achieve functionality | Views the system as a collection of interacting objects, each encapsulating data and behavior, with an emphasis on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. |

## Structured Analysis (SA) and Structured Design (SD):

- **Structured Analysis (SA):**
   - In structured analysis, the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is used to create a visual representation of the system's functionality. This is typically done using a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) model. The DFD illustrates how data moves through the system, highlighting processes, data stores, and data flows.

- **Structured Design (SD):**
   - Structured design takes the DFD model created during structured analysis and transforms it into a Structure Chart. The Structure Chart depicts the system's architecture, showing the modules or components and their relationships. It helps in organizing and planning the implementation of the system.

## Data Flow Diagrams:

- A DFD, also known as a bubble chart, is a straightforward graphical representation that is employed to depict a system in relation to its input data, the different processes it carries out on this data, and the resultant output data generated by the system.

- The DFD model employs a small set of basic symbols to illustrate the functions performed by a system and the flow of data among these functions. This simplifies the representation of system processes and their interactions.

## Structured Design and Structure Chart:

- The primary goal of structured design is to convert the outcomes of structured analysis, which is typically the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) model, into a structure chart. The structure chart serves as a graphical representation of the software's architecture.

- A structure chart is particularly concerned with illustrating the module structure within the software and the interactions among these modules. However, it does not focus on representing the procedural aspects, such as the detailed steps involved in achieving a specific functionality.

- The structure chart representation can be easily translated into actual implementation using a programming language, making it a valuable tool for planning and organizing the development of software systems.

## Unified Modeling Language (UML):

- UML serves as a language for documenting models in software engineering.

- It encompasses both syntax (rules for forming sentences and using basic symbols) and semantics (meaning of symbols and sentences).

- UML offers a range of fundamental graphical notations, such as rectangles, lines, ellipses, etc. These elements can be combined in specific ways to document design and analysis outcomes.


## UML Diagrams and Their Views:

UML diagrams are used to represent various views or models of a system. These diagrams include:

1. **User's View:**
   - *Use Case Diagram:*
      - Represents the interactions between users and the system, focusing on functionalities or use cases.

## Design Patterns
- A design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
- It is a description for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
- Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects.

## Why do we need design Patterns:
- Creating a class properly
- Instantiating an object to a particular class
- Interaction between objects
- Write loosely coupled code
- Write reusable code

## Advantages of Using Design Patterns in Software Engineering:

- **Reusability:** Design patterns offer tried and tested solutions for reusing in software development.
- **Standardized Terminology:** They establish a common language for developers to communicate and understand design concepts.
- **Higher-Level Perspective:** Design patterns provide a higher-level view of the software architecture.
- **Enhanced Modifiability:** Most patterns make software more flexible and less prone to breaking during changes.
- **Loose Coupling:** Patterns promote loosely coupled applications for better maintainability.
- **Improved Understanding:** They aid in comprehending fundamental object-oriented design principles.

## 5 Basic Components of a Design Pattern:

- **Name:** Identifies the pattern for easy reference and discussion.
- **Problem:** Describes the specific software design issue the pattern addresses.
- **Solution:** Offers a proven approach or template to solve the identified problem.
- **Consequences and Trade-offs:** Outlines the benefits, drawbacks, and considerations of applying the pattern.
- **Implementation:** Provides an architecture using a design class diagram to visualize the pattern's structure.

## Pattern Name:

- **Identification Purpose:** Identifies the specific pattern addressing a particular problem in software design.
- **Descriptive Function:** Used to articulate and define a design challenge within a system.
- **Enhanced Vocabulary:** Naming a pattern expands the design terminology, enabling higher-level conceptualization.
- **Facilitates Abstract Design:** Supports the creation of designs at a more conceptual and less detailed level.
- **Simplified Discussion:** Allows for discussions and evaluations of designs without getting bogged down in implementation specifics.
- **Recalls Problem and Solution:** A well-chosen pattern name should evoke the problems it resolves and the corresponding solution.
- **Examples:** Singleton, Factory Method, Prototype.

## Pattern Problem:

- **Application Context:** Defines the circumstances and context in which the pattern is relevant and beneficial.
- **Problem Description:** Specifies the design challenge being addressed, which may include converting algorithms into object representations.
- **Identifies Design Issues:** Pinpoints class or object configurations indicative of a rigid and less adaptable design.
- **Conditions for Application:** Occasionally outlines a set of prerequisites that must be met before applying the pattern becomes meaningful.

## The Solution
- The solution describes the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.
- The solution doesn't describe a particular concrete design or implementation, because a pattern is like a template that can be applied in many different situations.
- Instead, the pattern provides an abstract description of a design problem and how a general arrangement of elements (classes and objects in our case) solves it

## The Consequences
- The consequences are the results and trade-offs of applying thepattern.
- The consequences for software often concern space and time trade-offs.
- They may address language and implementation issues as well.
- Since reuse is often a factor in object-oriented design, the consequences of a pattern include its impact on a system's flexibility, extensibility, or portability.
- Listing these consequences explicitly helps you understand and evaluate them


## Advantages of Using Patterns with Java:

- **Proven Solutions:** Patterns embody the wisdom and expertise of developers who have effectively applied them in practice.
- **Reusability:** Patterns offer pre-fabricated solutions that can be customized for various scenarios and requirements.
- **Expressiveness:** They furnish a shared language of solutions, enabling concise expression of complex solutions.
- **Built-in Support in J2EE:** Java's J2EE platform includes built-in support for various design patterns, streamlining their implementation.


## Design Patterns in Smalltalk MVC:

- **MVC in Smalltalk-80:** Utilizes the Model/View/Controller (MVC) trio of classes for constructing user interfaces in Smalltalk-80.
- **Components of MVC:**
  - **Model (M):** Represents the application object.
  - **View (V):** Deals with the screen presentation.
  - **Controller (C):** Dictates how the user interface responds to user interactions.
- **Decoupling for Flexibility and Reuse:** MVC emphasizes decoupling to enhance flexibility and promote reusability in software design.



## MVC Architectural Design Pattern:

![image](https://github.com/hunterz-killer/S4-Notes/assets/82221655/62bc85b1-1281-4153-a1f2-b2aa1606c5d0)


- **User Interface Construction:** Used as a framework for building user interfaces.
- **Components of MVC:**
   - **Model:**
     - Contains only pure application data, devoid of presentation logic.
     - Responds to requests from views and instructions from controllers.
   - **View:**
     - Presents the model's data to the user.
     - Multiple views can be associated with a single model for different purposes.
     - Must update its presentation if the model's data changes.
   - **Controller:**
     - Receives user input and triggers responses by invoking appropriate model operations.
     - Accepts user input, instructs the model to perform actions accordingly.
     - Translates user interactions with its associated view into actions for the model.
     - Can create new views based on user demands.


## Pros and Cons of SmallTalk MVC:

**Pros:**

- **Effective Division of Responsibilities:** SmallTalk MVC effectively divides responsibilities, ensuring clear advantages.
- **Isolation of Domain and Presentation Logic:** Allows developers to alter domain models without impacting presentation logic, and vice versa.
- **Individualized Development Environments:** Developers can work in their preferred view, enhancing productivity.
- **Diverse User Interface Creation:** Permits the creation of various user interfaces (GUI, command-line, etc.) without affecting application logic.

**Cons:**

- **Increased Abstraction Complexity:** The use of multiple abstractions can lead to increased complexity in the framework.
- **Necessity for Broad Technological Knowledge:** Developers need to be well-versed in a variety of technologies due to the pattern's complexity.

## Elements of design pattern
The 13 elements used to describe a design pattern are typically:

1. **Pattern Name:** Provides a unique identifier for the design pattern.
2. **Problem:** Describes the specific software design issue or scenario the pattern addresses.
3. **Solution:** Presents the design structure, components, and interactions to resolve the identified problem.
4. **Intent:** Outlines the overarching goal or purpose of the pattern.
5. **Motivation:** Provides a detailed scenario or example to illustrate when and why the pattern is useful.
6. **Applicability:** Specifies the circumstances in which the pattern is most applicable and effective.
7. **Structure:** Illustrates the components and their relationships within the pattern.
8. **Participants (or Classes/Objects):** Identifies the key elements involved in the pattern and their roles.
9. **Collaborations:** Describes how the participants work together to fulfill the pattern's intent.
10. **Consequences:** Discusses the advantages, disadvantages, trade-offs, and considerations of using the pattern.
11. **Implementation:** Offers guidance on how to implement the pattern in code, including language-specific details.
12. **Sample Code (if applicable):** Provides an example code snippet to demonstrate the pattern's implementation.
13. **Known Uses:** Presents real-world examples or instances where the pattern has been successfully applied.

These elements collectively form a comprehensive description of a design pattern, enabling developers to understand, apply, and adapt it in their own software designs.



## Expectations from User Interface Design:

- The User Interface should align with the skills, experience, and expectations of its anticipated users.
- Users tend to evaluate a product based on its interface rather than just its functionality.
- A poorly designed interface can lead to significant user errors.
- Many software products go unused due to subpar user interfaces.

## Importance of Interface:

- The interface is often the most crucial aspect of a system, as it represents the system for most users.
- Its significance is continuously growing in the software development process.
- Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) represent a substantial improvement over earlier approaches.
- Major platforms like Mac and Microsoft provide style guides for interface design.
- Approximately 50% of code is devoted to handling the interface.

## Benefits of Good Design:

- Even small interface improvements can yield significant financial gains.
- Interface problems are treated with the same urgency as software bugs.
- Substantial improvements can lead to the creation of entirely new products.
- Revolutionary ideas like the browser's user interface transformed how we access information online.
- Companies like Google have thrived with simple yet effective user interfaces.

## Interface Design: Typical Errors:

- Lack of consistency in design elements.
- Requiring excessive memorization from the user.
- Insufficient guidance or help for users navigating the interface.
- Lack of context sensitivity, making it challenging to understand the current state.
- Poor responsiveness, leading to frustration and delays.
- The interface being unnecessarily complex or unfriendly to users.


## Golden Rules of User Interface Design:

- **Place the User in Control:** Empower the user to take charge of their interactions with the interface, providing clear and intuitive navigation and controls.

- **Reduce the User's Memory Load:** Minimize the need for users to remember information or learn complex procedures by presenting information and options clearly and accessibly.

- **Make the Interface Consistent:** Ensure that elements, layouts, and interactions are uniform throughout the interface, establishing predictability and familiarity for the user.


## User interface design principles

| Principle           | Description                                                                             |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User familiarity    | The interface should use terms and concepts which are drawn from the experience of the people who will make most use of the system. |
| Consistency         | The interface should be consistent in that, wherever possible, comparable operations should be activated in the same way. |
| Minimal surprise    | Users should never be surprised by the behavior of a system.                            |
| Recoverability      | The interface should include mechanisms to allow users to recover from errors.         |
| User guidance       | The interface should provide meaningful feedback when errors occur and provide context-sensitive user help facilities. |
