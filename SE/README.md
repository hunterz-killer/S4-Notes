## Important Concepts and Terminologies Associated with Layered Design:

1. **Superordinate and Subordinate Modules:**
   - **Superordinate Modules:** These are higher-level modules that oversee and coordinate the activities of subordinate modules.
   - **Subordinate Modules:** These are lower-level modules that perform specific tasks and report to superordinate modules.

2. **Visibility:**
   - Refers to the degree to which one module can access or interact with another module. It is controlled by the design and encapsulation of the modules.

3. **Control Abstraction:**
   - The level of control and detail a module has over its subordinate modules. It defines how modules interact to achieve a specific function.

4. **Depth and Width:**
   - **Depth:** Refers to the number of hierarchical levels in the layered design, indicating the depth of the module hierarchy.
   - **Width:** Indicates the number of sibling modules at the same level in the hierarchy.

5. **Fan-Out:**
   - The number of subordinate modules controlled or invoked by a superordinate module. High fan-out can indicate complex control relationships.

6. **Fan-In:**
   - The number of superordinate modules that reference or use a particular subordinate module. High fan-in suggests reusability and a modular design.

## Cohesion and Coupling:

- **Cohesion:**
   - Cohesion is a measure of the functional strength of a module. It indicates how closely related and focused the tasks performed by a module are. High cohesion means a module performs a single, well-defined function.

- **Coupling:**
   - Coupling is a measure of the degree of interaction or interdependence between two modules. Low coupling indicates that modules are relatively independent and can be changed or maintained with minimal impact on other modules.

<br>


[![Go to Top](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go%20to%20Top-blue)](#table-of-contents)

----


<br>


## Functional Independence:

- **Definition:** Functional independence in software design means that a module is capable of performing a single task with minimal interaction with other modules.

- A module that exhibits both high cohesion and low coupling with other modules is considered functionally independent.

<br>


[![Go to Top](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go%20to%20Top-blue)](#table-of-contents)

----


<br>


## Advantages of Functional Independence:

1. **Better Understandability:**
   - Functional independence reduces design complexity, making it easier to understand the design document. Clear boundaries between modules simplify comprehension.

2. **Isolation:**
   - Isolated modules are self-contained and easily understood within the design. This isolation makes it straightforward to locate and address errors or issues.

3. **Scope of Reuse:**
   - Functionally independent modules are more reusable. They can be readily applied in the development of other applications, promoting efficiency and code reuse.

<br>


## Cohesion and Its Types:

- **Cohesion:** Cohesion is a measure of the functional strength of a module. It indicates how closely related and focused the tasks performed by a module are. Good cohesion implies that the functions within a module cooperate to achieve a single objective.

- **Types of Cohesion:**
1. **Functional Cohesion:**
   - All the functions within the module collaborate to achieve a single, well-defined objective. This is the highest level of cohesion.
 
3. **Sequential Cohesion:**
4. Functions within the module are organized in a sequence, with the output of one function serving as the input to the next.

5. **Communicational Cohesion:** Functions within the module operate on the same data or share data among themselves.

6. **Procedural Cohesion:** Functions within the module are grouped based on their execution sequence, but they may not necessarily have a single objective.

7. **Temporal Cohesion:** Functions within the module are executed at the same time, although they may have different purposes.

8. **Logical Cohesion:** Functions within the module have a logical relationship but do not necessarily share data or have a single objective.

 9. **Coincidental Cohesion:** Functions within the module are grouped together by coincidence or convenience rather than any meaningful relationship. This is the lowest level of cohesion.

<br>

----


<br>


## Coupling and Its Types:

- **Coupling:** Coupling is a measure of the degree of interaction or interdependence between two modules. It indicates how much one module relies on or is affected by another module.

### Types of Coupling:

1. **Data Coupling:**
   - Data coupling occurs when two modules share data, but they do not share their internal logic. They exchange information using parameters or data structures.

2. **Stamp Coupling:**
   - Stamp coupling happens when modules share complex data structures, like records or arrays, and use only a portion of the data. This type of coupling should be avoided as it can lead to unnecessary dependencies.

3. **Control Coupling:**
   - Control coupling occurs when one module controls the behavior of another by passing control information. This implies a higher level of interdependence.

4. **Common Coupling:**
   - Common coupling arises when modules share global data. Any changes to the global data affect multiple modules, making them tightly coupled.

5. **Content Coupling:**
   - Content coupling is considered the strongest form of coupling. It occurs when one module accesses or modifies the internal data or behavior of another module.

## Structured Analysis (SA) and Structured Design (SD):

- **Structured Analysis (SA):**
   - In structured analysis, the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is used to create a visual representation of the system's functionality. This is typically done using a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) model. The DFD illustrates how data moves through the system, highlighting processes, data stores, and data flows.

- **Structured Design (SD):**
   - Structured design takes the DFD model created during structured analysis and transforms it into a Structure Chart. The Structure Chart depicts the system's architecture, showing the modules or components and their relationships. It helps in organizing and planning the implementation of the system.

<br>

<br>


## Data Flow Diagrams:

- A DFD, also known as a bubble chart, is a straightforward graphical representation that is employed to depict a system in relation to its input data, the different processes it carries out on this data, and the resultant output data generated by the system.

- The DFD model employs a small set of basic symbols to illustrate the functions performed by a system and the flow of data among these functions. This simplifies the representation of system processes and their interactions.

<br>


## Structured Design and Structure Chart:

- The primary goal of structured design is to convert the outcomes of structured analysis, which is typically the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) model, into a structure chart. The structure chart serves as a graphical representation of the software's architecture.

- A structure chart is particularly concerned with illustrating the module structure within the software and the interactions among these modules. However, it does not focus on representing the procedural aspects, such as the detailed steps involved in achieving a specific functionality.

- The structure chart representation can be easily translated into actual implementation using a programming language, making it a valuable tool for planning and organizing the development of software systems.

<br>


## Unified Modeling Language (UML):

- UML serves as a language for documenting models in software engineering.

- It encompasses both syntax (rules for forming sentences and using basic symbols) and semantics (meaning of symbols and sentences).

- UML offers a range of fundamental graphical notations, such as rectangles, lines, ellipses, etc. These elements can be combined in specific ways to document design and analysis outcomes.

- **User Interface Construction:** Used as a framework for building user interfaces.
- **Components of MVC:**
   - **Model:**
     - Contains only pure application data, devoid of presentation logic.
     - Responds to requests from views and instructions from controllers.
   - **View:**
     - Presents the model's data to the user.
     - Multiple views can be associated with a single model for different purposes.
     - Must update its presentation if the model's data changes.
   - **Controller:**
     - Receives user input and triggers responses by invoking appropriate model operations.
     - Accepts user input, instructs the model to perform actions accordingly.
     - Translates user interactions with its associated view into actions for the model.
     - Can create new views based on user demands.

## Integration Testing Strategies:

1. **Big Bang Integration Testing:**
   - In this approach, all the components or units are integrated simultaneously, and the entire system is tested as a whole. It's typically used for smaller projects and may not be suitable for large, complex systems.

2. **Top-Down Integration Testing:**
   - This strategy begins with testing the top-level modules or components and progressively integrates and tests lower-level modules. It ensures that the higher-level functionalities are working correctly before moving to lower levels.

3. **Bottom-Up Integration Testing:**
   - In contrast to top-down integration, bottom-up integration testing starts with the lower-level modules or components and progressively integrates and tests higher-level modules. This approach allows for early testing of core functionalities.

4. **Sandwich Testing:**
   - Also known as Mixed Integration Testing, this approach combines elements of both top-down and bottom-up strategies. It involves testing the middle layers while incrementally integrating both higher and lower-level modules.

5. **Regression Testing:**
   - Regression testing is not a specific integration strategy but is essential during integration. It involves retesting the entire system, or specific components, whenever a change is made to ensure that new modifications do not introduce new issues or break existing functionality.

6. **Smoke Testing:**
   - Smoke testing is usually conducted before detailed integration testing. It verifies that the system's most crucial functions are working correctly and can be seen as a preliminary test to check if further testing is warranted.
