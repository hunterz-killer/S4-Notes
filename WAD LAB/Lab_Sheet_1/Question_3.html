                Tamil Nadu, known as the textile capital of South India or the Manchester of the South, the city is
                situated on the banks of the river Noyyal, Coimbatore existed even prior to the 2nd or 3rd century AD by
                Karikalan, the first of the early Cholas. Among its other great rulers were Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas,

                Tamil, in which it is called Kovai.
